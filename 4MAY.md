# Stripe Coach Platform â€” Project Overview (4 May, updated 18 May)

## 1. Current Build Summary
- **Platform:** Next.js (React), Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage), Stripe (payments), Redis (Upstash, for AI cache)
- **User Roles:** Coach, Client, Admin
- **Core Features:**
  - Authentication & Role Management (NextAuth, Google/email, secret key set)
  - Client Onboarding & Profile Management
  - Check-in System (with photo upload, reminders, analytics)
  - Program Management (templates, assignments, tracking)
  - AI Insights (coach-only, now with distributed Redis cache)
  - Coach Notes & Client History
  - Payment Integration (Stripe)
  - Admin & Analytics Dashboards
  - Feedback & Notification System
- **Current Mode:**
  - Main client profile page (`/coach/clients/[id]`) uses comprehensive mock data for all features and navigation.
  - Firestore and Stripe integration are scaffolded and ready for production data.
  - **AI insights now use distributed Redis cache (Upstash) for scalability.**
  - **Sentry error monitoring is live (server & client).**
  - **NextAuth secret is set and validated.**

## 2. Dataflow Architecture

**Frontend:**
- Next.js app with role-based routing and dynamic pages.
- State managed via React hooks and context (AuthContext, etc).
- UI components for dashboard, profile, check-ins, forms, analytics, etc.

**Backend (Firebase, Redis, Sentry):**
- **Auth:** Email/password, Google sign-in, role-based access (NextAuth, in progress for Google)
- **Firestore:**
  - `users` (profile, role, preferences)
  - `clients` (profile, progress, check-ins, forms)
  - `coaches` (profile, assigned clients, analytics)
  - `checkIns` (responses, metrics, photos)
  - `programs` (templates, assignments)
  - `auditLogs` (actions, compliance)
  - `feedback`, `notifications`, `files`, etc.
- **Storage:** For photo uploads, files, and resources.
- **Stripe:**
  - Subscription plans, invoices, webhook handling.
- **Redis (Upstash):**
  - Distributed cache for AI insights (5 min TTL, fallback on error)
- **Sentry:**
  - Error monitoring for both server and client

**Data Loading:**
- Pages/components fetch data via Firestore queries or use mock data if in dev mode.
- All sensitive/coach-only data (AI insights, notes) is only shown to coaches.
