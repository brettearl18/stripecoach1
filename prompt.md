## Tips for Using Prompts
1. Be specific in your prompts
2. Provide context when necessary
3. Break down complex questions into smaller, focused ones
4. Use these prompts as a starting point and customize them for your specific needs
5. Combine multiple prompts for comprehensive analysis
6. Use prompts to guide both development and debugging processes
