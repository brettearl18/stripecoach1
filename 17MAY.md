## Overview
This document summarizes the current status, recent progress, and next steps for the Stripe Coach AI-powered check-in platform as of 17 May.

## Connected & Working Dataflows
- **User Authentication:**
  - Users (coaches, clients, admins) can sign up, log in, and have roles assigned via Firebase Auth.
- **Firestore Database:**
  - All user, check-in, and template data is stored and retrieved from Firestore.
- **Check-In Creation:**
  - Check-ins can be created via the app UI (and now via the homepage test button), and are stored in the `checkIns` collection.
- **AI Summary Generation:**
  - New check-ins trigger the `generateCheckInSummary` Firebase Function, which calls OpenAI and writes the summary to Firestore.
- **Realtime Updates:**
  - Firestore listeners keep the UI in sync with database changes (e.g., new check-ins, updated summaries).
- **Notifications & Toasts:**
  - User actions (like creating a check-in) trigger toast notifications for feedback.
- **Admin/Coach/Client Dashboards:**
  - Role-based dashboards display relevant data and navigation for each user type.
- **Cloud Functions Monitoring:**
  - Function logs and status are available in the Firebase and Google Cloud consoles.

## Recent Progress
- **AI Summaries for Check-Ins:**
  - Firebase Function (`generateCheckInSummary`) is implemented and deployed (Node.js 20, 1st Gen).
  - Function is designed to generate AI-powered summaries for new check-ins using the OpenAI API.
  - All local build, lint, and dependency issues have been resolved.
  - TypeScript and Google Cloud Storage compatibility issues were fixed (using `skipLibCheck`).
  - Project is on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan and has Owner permissions.

- **Testing Workflow:**
  - A "Create Check-In Template" button was added to the homepage to easily create test check-ins in Firestore.
  - Button creates a new check-in document, which should trigger the AI summary function.
  - Function deployment and API enablement are confirmed in Firebase Console.

- **Cloud Functions:**
  - All required Google Cloud APIs are enabled.
  - Container image cleanup policy is set for Artifact Registry.

---

## Current State
- **Function is deployed and up-to-date.**
- **Homepage button for creating test check-ins is present.**
- **No critical errors in local build or deploy.**
- **Cloud Functions dashboard shows the function as deployed.**
- **Some previous deployment errors were resolved by updating Node.js version, TypeScript, and dependencies.**
- **No permission or billing issues detected.**

---

## Outstanding Issues / Next Steps
1. **Test End-to-End AI Workflow:**
   - Click the "Create Check-In Template" button on the homepage.
   - Confirm a new check-in document appears in Firestore.
   - Wait for the `aiInsights.summary` field to be populated by the function.
   - Check function logs for any errors if the summary does not appear.

2. **Fix Homepage Syntax Error:**
   - There is a JavaScript syntax error preventing the homepage scripts from running.
   - Review and fix any typos or invalid characters in `src/app/page.tsx`.
   - Run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` to catch and resolve errors.

3. **Surface AI Summary in UI:**
   - Once the function is confirmed working, display the AI summary in the coach or admin dashboard for review.

4. **Monitor and Iterate:**
   - Monitor function logs and OpenAI usage.
   - Collect feedback from coaches on summary quality.
   - Refine the AI prompt as needed.

5. **Plan for Next AI Features:**
   - Trend detection, risk alerts, personalized recommendations, photo analysis, etc.

## CTO Recommendations
- Validate the end-to-end workflow with real and edge-case data.
- Document the AI workflow and update onboarding docs for the team.
- Monitor costs and function performance.
- Plan for future AI features and UI improvements.
