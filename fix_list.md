# Fix List for Stripe Coach Platform

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### API Keys and Environment Variables
- [ ] **Critical**: OpenAI API key validation issue in avatar generation
  - Location: `src/app/api/avatars/generate/route.ts`
  - Issue: API key validation not properly implemented
  - Impact: Failed avatar generation requests
  - Recommendation: Implement proper API key validation and error handling

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **High**: Role-based access control needs strengthening
  - Location: `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
  - Issue: Basic role check without proper middleware
  - Impact: Potential unauthorized access to admin routes
  - Recommendation: Implement proper middleware for role verification

### Data Security
- [ ] **Medium**: Client data exposure in check-in forms
  - Location: `src/app/client/check-in/page.tsx`
  - Issue: Sensitive data visible in client-side code
  - Impact: Potential data privacy concerns
  - Recommendation: Move sensitive data handling to server-side

## Broken Links and Navigation Issues

### Admin Routes
- [ ] `/admin/dashboard2` - Implemented but needs cleanup
- [ ] `/admin/coaches` - Route exists but functionality incomplete
- [ ] `/admin/analytics` - Route exists but data visualization missing
- [ ] `/admin/calendar` - Route exists but calendar functionality not implemented
- [ ] `/admin/notifications` - Route exists but notification system not implemented

### Client Routes
- [ ] `/client/coach` - Route exists but coach profile data missing
- [ ] `/client/progress` - Route exists but progress tracking incomplete
- [ ] `/client/messages` - Route exists but messaging system not implemented
- [ ] `/client/subscription` - Route exists but subscription management incomplete

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/stripe/account/status` - Implemented but needs error handling
- [ ] `/api/stripe/account/connect` - Implemented but needs webhook handling
- [ ] `/api/avatars/generate` - Implemented but has API key issues

## Code Quality Issues

### TypeScript
- [ ] Missing type definitions in several components
- [ ] Inconsistent use of interfaces vs types
- [ ] Any types used in some places where specific types should be used

### React Components
- [ ] Some components missing proper error boundaries
- [ ] Inconsistent use of React hooks
- [ ] Missing loading states in some components

### Performance
- [ ] Large bundle sizes in some routes
- [ ] Missing image optimization
- [ ] Inefficient data fetching patterns

## Dependencies

### Outdated Packages
- [ ] Update Next.js to latest version
- [ ] Update React to latest version
- [ ] Update Firebase dependencies
- [ ] Update Stripe dependencies

### Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
- [ ] Run npm audit and address any findings
- [ ] Update packages with known vulnerabilities

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix OpenAI API key validation
2. Implement proper role-based access control
3. Move sensitive data handling to server-side
4. Add proper error boundaries to React components

### Short-term Improvements
1. Complete missing route implementations
2. Add proper TypeScript types
3. Implement proper loading states
4. Add proper error handling for API endpoints

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement comprehensive testing
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Implement proper logging system
4. Add automated security scanning

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize fixing critical security issues
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Complete missing route functionality
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Implement proper monitoring and logging
